# cybersecurity-soc-siem
A custom SIEM-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) built using ELK Stack, integrated with Nagios, Suricata, and OSSEC for real-time threat detection, monitoring, and incident response.

SIEM-Based Security Operations Center (SOC) Using ELK Stack, Nagios, Suricata & OSSEC


üìå Project Overview
This project implements a Security Operations Center (SOC) using an ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) as the central SIEM platform integrated with:

Nagios ‚Üí System and network monitoring

Suricata ‚Üí Network-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS)

OSSEC ‚Üí Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

The SOC is designed to collect, process, analyze, and visualize security logs in real-time, providing actionable insights for threat detection, incident response, and network health monitoring.


üéØ Objectives
Deploy an ELK-based SIEM for centralized log management.

Integrate multiple monitoring & intrusion detection tools into one SOC platform.

Create dashboards for real-time security event visualization.

Enable alerting & automated responses for critical security incidents.
